#How to view available containers
#We use the docker ps command to list running containers. If you want to see all containers in all states, pass the -a argument.
#Here is an example.


docker ps -a

#Here is the output from the above command.
#CONTAINER ID    IMAGE        COMMAND         CREATED       STATUS                                PORTS         NAMES
#d93d40cc1ce9    tmp-ubuntu:latest  "dotnet website.dll …"  6 seconds ago    Up 5 seconds        8080/tcp      happy_wilbur
#33a6cf71f7c1    tmp-ubuntu:latest  "dotnet website.dll …"  2 hours ago     Exited (0) 9 seconds ago            adoring_borg

#How to run a container
#Use the docker run command to start a container. We only need to specify the image to run with its name or ID to launch the container from the image. A container launched in this manner provides the user with an interactive experience.
#Here, we're adding the -d flag to run the container with our website in the background.

docker run -d tmp-ubuntu

#The command, in this case, only returns the ID of the new container.
#Once an image is specified to run, Docker finds the image, loads container from the image, and executes the command specified as the entry point. 
#It's at this point that the container is available for management.

#How to pause a container
#We use the docker pause command to pause a container. Here is an example.

docker pause happy_wilbur

#Pausing a container will suspend all processes. This command allows the container to continue processes at a later stage. 
#The docker unpause command unsuspends all processes.

#How to restart a container
#We use the docker restart command to restart containers. Here is an example.

docker restart happy_wilbur

#The container receives a stop command, followed by a start command. 
#If the container doesn't respond to the stop command, then a kill signal is sent.

#How to stop a container
#We use the docker stop command to stop a running container. Here is an example.

docker stop happy_wilbur

#The stop command sends a termination signal to the container and the process running in the container.

#How to remove a container
#We use the docker rm command to remove a container. Here is an example.

docker rm happy_wilbur

#All data in the container is destroyed once you remove the container. 
#It's essential to always consider containers as temporary when thinking about storing data.
